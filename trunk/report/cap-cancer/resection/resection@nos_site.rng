    CAP Schema for Synoptic Reports
    (c) Copyright 2008 College of American Pathologists
    ===========================================================================
    Component name:
    unspecified_site-resection.rng
    
    Component type:
    schema
    
    Version date:
    2008.12.02
    
    Defines:
    semistructured report schema for a resection at an unspecified site
    
    Purpose:
    This schema defines a report that includes all the sections appropriate
    for a biopsy report, but does not include any further internal structure
    within these sections. 
    
    This schema is in intent "abstract"; we do not anticipate it would ever
    be instantiated. It can be thought of as the schema for a report of a
    biopsy procedure at an unspecified site.
