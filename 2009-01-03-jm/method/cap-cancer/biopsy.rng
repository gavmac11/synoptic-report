    Component name:
    unspecified_site-biopsy.rng
    
    Component type:
    grammar for inclusion
    
    Version date:
    2008.12.02
    
    Defines:
    schema fragment defining the sections appropriate for a resection report, and 
    definining some as optional
    
    Purpose:
    This schema defines a report that includes all the sections appropriate
    for a biopsy report, but does not include any further internal structure
    within these sections. 
    
    This schema is "abstract" in intent; we do not anticipate it would ever
    be instantiated. It can be thought of as the schema for a report of a
    biopsy procedure at an unspecified site.
    
    Dependencies:
