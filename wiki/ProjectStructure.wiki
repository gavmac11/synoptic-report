#summary Package structure of project
#sidebar Contents

So now you know how the classes fit together to create a site- and method-specific data model (=schema). But where _are_ all these Relax NG classes in the Source folder? Which file is which?

This diagram shows the package (i.e. folder) structure of the project. These are the folder names you will see if you click on the *Source* tab up above and browse the repository. (Remember, for those new to Subversion, that the repository contains a main development  line in the *trunk* folder, various named, snapshotted versions of the entire project in the *tags* folder, and alternate development branches in the *branches* folder.)
