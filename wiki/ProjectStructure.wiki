#summary Package structure of project
#sidebar Contents

So now you know how the classes fit together to create a site- and method-specific data model (=schema). But where _are_ all these Relax NG classes in the Source folder? Which file is which?

This diagram shows the package (i.e. folder) structure of the project. These are the folder names you will see if you click on the *Source* tab up above and browse the repository. 

(For those new to Subversion, that the repository contains a main development  line in the *trunk* folder, various named, snapshotted versions of the entire project in the *tags* folder, and alternate development branches in the *branches* folder.)

Let's take these folders one at a time.

*report* is where you look to see the "completed" schema, that is to say, the full schema for, say, a "breast resection" or a "pelvic MRI" or the like. When you open this folder you will see that the contents are organized into subfolders, each one representing a particular report domain. Thus we have a *cap-cancer* folder that contains the schemas for CAP cancer report templates; a *cap-medicalKidney* folder that contains (as yet imaginary) templates for CAP medical kidney reports; and a *rsna-mri* folder that contains (again, as yet imaginary) RSNA MRI reports.

When you open */report/cap-cancer* you will see a couple of additional "convenience" subfolders that help organize the contents: a *biopsy* subfolder and a *resection* subfolder. This means what it says: all the schemas for various biopsy templates are in the one, for various resection templates are in the other.

When you look inside, let's say, the *resection* subfolder, you will see a bunch of schemas for resections at various sites. There is a *resection@breast.rng* file that represents the complete schema for a breast resection, and so on.

All files with a suffix of *.rng* are Relax NG schemas, in case you didn't know. (There may also be some *.xsd* files in there; these are the cognate XML Schema translations of the Relax NG schemas.) Open one up and look at it if you like, but I'll explain how these schemas are structured internally [ReportSchemaStructure elsewhere]. On this page, I just want to help you become familiar with the various packages (= folders).
