This project is a framework for expressing pathology/radiology reports in a structured fashion. The cornerstone design concept is to maintain a modular, loosely-coupled relationship among:

  # the user interface (a.k.a. user input/output form/format)
  # the underlying data model (a.k.a. report document schema, data persistence model)
  # the business rules defining valid combinations of data for specific purposes 
  # the sharable semantics (a.k.a. ontology binding)

This layered design mirrors an extended version of the classic model-view-controller paradigm, with the addition of a data integration layer below the model layer. Component #1 corresponds to the View layer. Component #2 corresponds to the Model layer. Component #3 corresponds to the Controller layer. Component #4 is an added data integration layer that sits below the Model (#2) layer and allows for data integration with other systems.

In this Google project, the focus is on #2 and #3. Here's a high-level overview in UML.

The data mode (blue background) has as its central artifact the red "Report Schema" class. In this project, this class is instantiated as a set of Relax NG schemas (which can be translated into XSD as required).

The "Business Rule" class (purple background) represents the definitive artifact of Component #3. In this project, this class is instantiated as a set of Schematron schemas. It is in a sense an extended part of the data model, so it lives also inside the blue background.

The red-background "User form" class is Component #1. This particular project will contain at most examples of implementations of the user layer, but the instantiation of this class is intended to be a form in any of the common, widely-used user frameworks that use XML artifacts (XML schema, XML exemplar documents, etc.) as the data binding targets for their form controls. This would include all the widely-used form frameworks currently available, including XForms, PDF Forms, InfoPath forms and WPF forms.

The branch containing the green "Mapping transform" class represents Component #4. As in the W3C GRDDL architecture, ontological representations of the data are viewed as resulting from an extraction process that begins with the domain-specific data, proceeds through an extraction/mapping event that is driven by a standardized mapping transform (instantiated in this project as GRDDL/XSLT) and results in a separate document that is the ontolgical "image" of the document content.

This project currently focuses on the data model and business rules portion of this plan. We will next look at how the schemas themselves are [Concept2 conceptualized].
