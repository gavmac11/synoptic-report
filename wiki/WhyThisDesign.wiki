#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

*1. Why aren't there any "codes" in the document instances? I want codes!*

Ah, but there are! There are no obscure numeric codes, but all the elements in this design reside in an XML namespace (http://purl.oclc.org/medical/report/ or namespaces that are derived from this). This means that the full name (or to use the official XML term, the namespace-qualified name) of (for example) the element that wraps information about the tumor histologic type in this project is:

     [nolink http://purl.oclc.org/medical/reporting/cap-cancer/histologicType]

Is that sufficiently "code-like" to suit you?

For those unfamiliar with XML, you just have to realize that because namespace-qualified names can be long and human-unfriendly (like any "codes"), the XML standard allows them to be "abbreviated" in schemas by declaring a default namespace in the document. This is what we do.

(One sidelight for XML connoisseurs: notice that while all out element names are in specific namespaces, the associated attributes are in no-namespace (i.e. the "" namespace). We could have put our attributes in a namespace (and it's a discussable point), but at the moment we believe that since these attributes only exist in associated with a "carrying' element, namespace restriction is unnecessary for them.)

*2. Why doesn't the document use SNOMED-CT (or LOINC, or UMLS, or RadLex) codes instead of your own XML element names? After all those coding systems are more widely used, whereas your system is novel!*

This question (unlike #1, which is a purely technical implementation decision) gets to the heart of our philosophy.
